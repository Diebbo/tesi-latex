@inproceedings{Brakerski2012-wj,
  title = "(Leveled) fully homomorphic encryption without bootstrapping",
  booktitle = "Proceedings of the 3rd Innovations in Theoretical Computer
               Science Conference",
  author = "Brakerski, Zvika and Gentry, Craig and Vaikuntanathan, Vinod",
  abstract = "We present a novel approach to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)
              that dramatically improves performance and bases security on weaker
              assumptions. A central conceptual contribution in our work is a new
              way of constructing leveled fully homomorphic encryption schemes
              (capable of evaluating arbitrary polynomial-size circuits), without
              Gentry's bootstrapping procedure. Specifically, we offer a choice
              of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or ring-LWE
              (RLWE) problems that have 2$\lambda$ security against known
              attacks. For RLWE, we have: • A leveled FHE scheme that can
              evaluate L-level arithmetic circuits with {\~O}($\lambda$ · L3)
              per-gate computation -- i.e., computation quasi-linear in the
              security parameter. Security is based on RLWE for an approximation
              factor exponential in L. This construction does not use the
              bootstrapping procedure. • A leveled FHE scheme that uses
              bootstrapping as an optimization, where the per-gate computation
              (which includes the bootstrapping procedure) is {\~O}($\lambda$2),
              independent of L. Security is based on the hardness of RLWE for
              quasi-polynomial factors (as opposed to the sub-exponential factors
              needed in previous schemes). We obtain similar results to the above
              for LWE, but with worse performance. Based on the Ring LWE
              assumption, we introduce a number of further optimizations to our
              schemes. As an example, for circuits of large width -- e.g., where
              a constant fraction of levels have width at least $\lambda$ -- we
              can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version to
              {\~O}($\lambda$), independent of L, by batching the bootstrapping
              operation. Previous FHE schemes all required $\Omega$($\lambda$3.5)
              computation per gate. At the core of our construction is a much
              more effective approach for managing the noise level of
              lattice-based ciphertexts as homomorphic operations are performed,
              using some new techniques recently introduced by Brakerski and
              Vaikuntanathan (FOCS 2011).",

              transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
              (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit
              microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while
              constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
              Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a
              typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for
              machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
              building automation. CoAP provides a request/response interaction
              model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of
              services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such
              as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily
              interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting
              specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low
              overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.},
